# Initial Concept

A full-stack land title tracking system for the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) in La Union, Philippines, designed to transition the Land Tenure Services division from fragmented spreadsheets to a centralized, reliable source of truth.

# Product Definition

## Vision
To provide a centralized and transparent digital system for tracking land titles across La Union, bridging the gap between the collaborative flexibility of spreadsheets and the data integrity of a professional management system.

## Target Users
- **DAR Personnel (LTS Division):** Staff transitioning from manual spreadsheet tracking to a structured digital workflow.
- **Division Chiefs:** For oversight, bottleneck identification, and workload management.
- **Government Officials:** For high-level progress monitoring across the province.

## Core Goals (The "Why" Beyond the Dashboard)
- **Ensure Data Integrity:** Prevent accidental deletions, overwrites, and inconsistent formatting that plague shared spreadsheets.
- **Build Institutional Memory:** Maintain a permanent, unchangeable audit log of who changed what and when—something spreadsheets cannot reliably provide.
- **Standardize Workflows:** Ensure every municipality follows the same checkpoints, making it easier for staff to collaborate and cover for one another.
- **Facilitate Gradual Transition:** Use cloud-integration features to act as a bridge, allowing staff to leverage spreadsheet-like efficiency while gaining system-level reliability.

## Key Features
- **Municipality Dashboard:** provincial and municipality-level progress visualization.
- **Structured Title Management:** Validation-heavy forms to ensure data is clean before it enters the system.
- **Checkpoint-Based Tracking:** A clear "kanban-style" or list view of where each title sits in the administrative pipeline.
- **Cloud Spreadsheet Sync (The Bridge):** A planned feature to import/export data to familiar tools, reducing the "fear" of a hard transition.
- **User Management & Security:** Secure, role-based access control to ensure that only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive land title data.

## Future Roadmap
- **Bi-directional Cloud Sync:** Live synchronization with Excel Online/Google Sheets.
- **Automated Reporting:** One-click generation of official DAR progress reports (PDF/Excel).
- **Audit Logging:** Detailed history of all title modifications for accountability.
- **Document Management:** Attaching scanned title copies directly to the digital record.
